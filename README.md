# react-boilerplate

A quick start boilerplate for web projects that will use React, Babel ES6/ES2015, JSX and Webpack

## Using this boilerplate

To start your React project with this boilerplate:

* Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/tiagostutz/react-boilerplate.git`.
* Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com): `npm install`. 
* Start with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com): `npm run start`.

I am using the ATOM editor with Seti UI Theme, that changes the icons of the files based on their type and One Dark Syntax Theme
